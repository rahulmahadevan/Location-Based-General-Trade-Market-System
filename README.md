# Android-Location-Based-Trade-System

Location based Trade/E-commerce System is a project which aims in developing a client-server based Mobile and Web application for Customers and Local Traders to do business or trade. 

The project aims to support General Trade market to provide better connectivity with customers nearby. This project is aimed to solve problems in most e-commerce systems such as, it takes at least 24 hours to get a product delivered to a customer, there is no guarantee that the delivered product is the same as the product ordered.

It is most efficient when product is received by customer instantly, the customer can examine the product before buying and the customer can buy the product from trusted stores in his/her locality while always having a scope to exchange and return instantly. This project has many features which makes all functionalities available to users in a user-friendly manner.

It has also the facility where customers can order the products they want from the stores of their choice which make this system partially an e-commerce. Overall this project is aimed to help customers find the products they need from the traders in their locality, thereby, helping both to make a trade. It also aims to motivate customers to keep up the spirit of tradition store visit shopping than just getting everything delivered to their homes. The project implements many techniques to create user-friendly, secure and robust system. The use of Hash based values for storing passwords and encryption for user sensitive data and digital signatures are some of the security techniques used. The development of website and mobile application should be in such a way that only the features in both must be easy to use and understand on any given platform for which many design principles are applied.

Scope:
The system will be a platform where customers and local (nearby) traders are connected
by the item(s) for trade through the system which will be available on the Web and Mobile App.
This system will be helpful for customers to find the item they need from the nearby traders. It
will also maximize the sales of a trader as customers will visit stores to purchase their items or
order the items home. For example, a particular medicine prescribed to a patient and is not
available in the store known to a customer, then the app can be used to search for nearby shops
where the medicine is available. The customer can order for an item or simply find the location
of the nearest trader to purchase it by hand. It can be categorised as semi e-commerce as it is not
necessary that the customers will purchase an item through the system.
